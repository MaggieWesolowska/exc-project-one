            Down the Rabbit Hole
          </h2>
          <div class="card-a__story">
            <p class="card-a__text">
              Alice was beginning to get very tired of
              sitting by her sister on the bank, and of
              having nothing to do: once or twice she had
              peeped into the book her sister was reading,
              but it had no pictures or conversations in it,
              “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
              “without pictures or conversations?”
            </p>
            <p class="card-a__text">
              So she was considering in her own mind (as
              well as she could, for the hot day made her
              feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
              pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
              worth the trouble of getting up and picking
              the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with
              pink eyes ran close by her.
            </p>
            <p class="card-a__text">
              There was nothing so very remarkable in that;
              nor did Alice think it so very much out of the
              way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
              dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she
              thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her
              that she ought to have wondered at this, but
              at the time it all seemed quite natural); but
              when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of
              its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and
              then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,
              for it flashed across her mind that she had
              never before seen a rabbit with either a
              waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of
              it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
              the field after it, and fortunately was just
              in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole
              under the hedge.
            </p>
            <p class="card-a__text">
              In another moment down went Alice after it,
              never once considering how in the world she
              was to get out again.
