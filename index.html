              Down the Rabbit Hole
            </h2>
            <div class="down__story">
              <p class="down__text">
                Alice was beginning to get very tired of
                sitting by her sister on the bank, and of
                having nothing to do: once or twice she had
                peeped into the book her sister was reading,
                but it had no pictures or conversations in
                it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought
                Alice “without pictures or conversations?”
              </p>
              <p class="down__text">
                So she was considering in her own mind (as
                well as she could, for the hot day made her
                feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
                pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
                worth the trouble of getting up and picking
                the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
                with pink eyes ran close by her.
              </p>
              <p class="down__text">
                There was nothing so very remarkable in
                that; nor did Alice think it so very much
                out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
                itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!”
                (when she thought it over afterwards, it
                occurred to her that she ought to have
                wondered at this, but at the time it all
                seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit
                actually took a watch out of its
                waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then
                hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for
                it flashed across her mind that she had
                never before seen a rabbit with either a
                waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of
                it, and burning with curiosity, she ran
                across the field after it, and fortunately
                was just in time to see it pop down a large
                rabbit-hole under the hedge.
              </p>
              <p class="down__text">
                In another moment down went Alice after it,
                never once considering how in the world she
                was to get out again.

            <p class="down__text">
              Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was
              so much surprised, that for the moment she
              quite forgot how to speak good English); “now
              I’m opening out like the largest telescope
              that ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for when she
              looked down at her feet, they seemed to be
              almost out of sight, they were getting so far
              off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who
              will put on your shoes and stockings for you
              now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall
              be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
              about you: you must manage the best way you
              can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought
              Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I
              want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new
              pair of boots every Christmas.” And she went
              on planning to herself how she would manage
              it. “They must go by the carrier,” she
              thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending
              presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the
              directions will look!
            </p>
            <p class="down__text">
              Just then her head struck against the roof of
              the hall: in fact she was now more than nine
              feet high, and she at once took up the little
              golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
              Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do,
              lying down on one side, to look through into
              the garden with one eye; but to get through
              was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and
              began to cry again. “You ought to be ashamed
              of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like
              you,” (she might well say this), “to go on
              crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell
              you!” But she went on all the same, shedding
              gallons of tears, until there was a large pool
              all round her, about four inches deep and
              reaching half down the hall.
            </p>
            <p class="down__text">
              After a time she heard a little pattering of
              feet in the distance, and she hastily dried
              her eyes to see what was coming. It was the
              White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed,
              with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand
              and a large fan in the other: he came trotting
              along in a great hurry, muttering to himself
              as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh!
              won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!”
              Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to
              ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came
              near her, she began, in a low, timid voice,
              “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started
              violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
              the fan, and skurried away into the darkness
              as hard as he could go.
            </p>
            <p class="down__text">
              Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the
              hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself
              all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear!
              How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday
              things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve
              been changed in the night? Let me think: was I
              the same when I got up this morning? I almost
              think I can remember feeling a little
              different. But if I’m not the same, the next
              question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s
              the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over
              all the children she knew that were of the
              same age as herself, to see if she could have
              been changed for any of them.

          Charles Lutwidge Dodgson - better known by his pen
          name Lewis Carroll, was an English author, poet,
          mathematician and photographer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice Liddell – a daughter of Henry Liddell, the
          Dean of Christ Church – is widely identified as
          the original inspiration for Alice in Wonderland,
          though Carroll always denied this.
